# Data Protection Law

## Summary

UK GDPR gives control back to data subjects (you), gives more obligations to the data controllers (uni) and gives more power to the regulator (ICO).

## Personal Data

Any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier.

- Structured information
- About a living individual
- Identifiable directly or indirectly
- Online identifiers
- Automated personal data and manual filing systems

## "Motivated intruder" test

> ICO: "The fact that there is a very slight hypothetical possibility that someone might be able to reconstruct the data in such a way that the individual is identified is not necessarily sufficient to make the individual identifiable"

Consider:

- Cost involved and time that would be needed to identify an individual

- Technology available that would facilitate the identification of an individual and likely developments in technology.

- Estimated value of the information if individuals were identified

> Mitigating the risk of re-identification
