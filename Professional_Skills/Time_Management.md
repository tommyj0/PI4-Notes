# Time Management - DJ Beard

## Suggestions for managerial improvements

1. Work Closely with staff as a team and listen to what they say. They can:
    - Filter and route phone calls
    - Filter the mail
    - Book appts. on your behalf
    - Isolate yourself from unimportant matters.
    - Make suggestions for improvements in time and resource allocations.

2. If in doubt, throw it out and be ruthless

3. Only hold necessary meetings

4. Keep meetings on track

5. Prepare for meetings to get the most out of them.

6. Communicate verbally to allow feedback

7. Communicate briefly in writing only when necessary

8. Reverse "Parkinson's Law". It has been running for many years so it should not be too difficult. One way to begin to reverse "Parkinson's Law" is to look into the future and bock out "A Time" for important tasks.

9. Also book in advance blocks of time in your diary for regular tasks such as monthly reports, work schedules.

14. Be aware of the difference between urgent tasks and important takss

15. Do not let other impose unnecessary work on you or your team

16. Use unproductive time, including travelling and waiting time, to analyse important issues

17. Prepare before an arranged encounter.

18. Record and review how you use your time

19. Develop a routine

20. When you have a major piece of work to do, gather the information you need and retreat to a public library

21. Develop and encourage staff to take over your job to free you to work out the next step forward. 

22. Encourage people to work through your staff and not with you direct.

23. If you are genuinely critically engaged when na interruption occurs then just politely say so.

## 12 Tips to be judged effective in work

1. Carry a pad for preparing a prioritised “do list” and taking notes relating to the progress of your work and your conversations with others – especially your boss.

2. Seek clarification if you are not sure about important issues – don’t just have a go and hope you get it right.

3. Focus on results in your work, not tasks. Tasks are only vehicles to achieve results.

4. Always be positive, helpful and constructive in your dealings with others, even if you are dealing with a potentially negative issue.

5. Understand “Moments of Truth”, which I define as any form of contact with others. At the end of a “Moment of Truth” everyone involved should know what will happen next, by when it will happen and who will be taking any actions.

6. Have a can do, will do, attitude.

7. Do not show your dislike for anyone.

8. Adopt carefully selected mentors.

9. Understand how your boss operates, what they think is important, and how they will judge you.

10. Keep your boss informed about the progress of your work.

11. Offer help if other team members have problems.

12. Do your “homework” before you bring about an encounter with others, and always consider potential downsides to any course of action you are suggesting.
